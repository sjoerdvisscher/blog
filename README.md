Sjoerd Visscher's Blog
======================

Welcome!
--------

I've started a new blog again, after [the previous one][1] broke down almost 6 years ago. So this time I wanted a blog that would not break down, and which would take me minimal effort to set up. Well, having a git repository with a bunch of textfiles is as minimal as you can get. And I don't have to worry about the design either, I can't change it even if I wanted to, which is very liberating.

This blog will be mostly about code, and about Haskell in particular.

Thanks to Yahoo Pipes there's [a content feed of this blog][5], but you can also watch this repository if you have an account on GitHub, subscribe to [the commits feed][2], or follow me on [Twitter][3] or [Google+][4].
