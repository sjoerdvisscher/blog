# Sjoerd Visscher's Blog
## Welcome!

I've started a new blog again, after [the previous one][1] broke down almost 6 years ago. So this time I wanted a blog that would not break down, and which would take me minimal effort to set up. Well, having a git repository with a bunch of textfiles is as minimal as you can get. And I don't have to worry about the design either, I can't change it even if I wanted to, which is very liberating.

This blog will be mostly about code, and about Haskell in particular.

If you want to follow this blog, simply watch the repository if you have an account on GitHub, subscribe to [the commits feed][2], or follow me on [Twitter][3] or [Google+][4].
